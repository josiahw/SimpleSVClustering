# SimpleSVClustering
A simple implementation of support vector clustering in only python/numpy

This implements a version of support vector clustering from the paper:
"A Support Vector Method for Clustering", A. Ben-Hur et al.

The implementation is fairly basic but performant for datasets of up to 5,000 (~ 5 min). I am only aware of a few other implementations of support vector clustering, none of which are as approachable. Hopefully somebody finds it useful, or at least informative.
